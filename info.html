    <h1>About me </h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I'm Jeganathan S from Namakkal.
        <br>

         <br>
         I finished my schooling at PGP Higher Secondary School, and now I'm studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering (B.E. EEE)...
        Besides my studies, I have hobbies that I really enjoy. I love reading books, spending time in nature, and taking care of pets and plants.
        My short term goals are to improve my personal finance knowledge, become better at socializing, and make more connections with people..
        In the long run, I want to start my own business that will help both society and the environment.
        I believe my strengths include determination and the ability to handle challenges.
        While I don't like to focus on my weaknesses, I know there's always room to grow and improve.I've participated in project presentations, and I was fortunate to get the 2nd place at Selvam College, which shows my passion for learning and trying new things.
        
        Overall, I'm a motivated person with big dreams in engineering and entrepreneurship. I want to make a positive impact on the world while enjoying the simple pleasures of life.</p>
